Task 1: Basic Table
Data Information:
● You’ll be working with the data set here
● The dataset provides information on ML Engineer salaries from 2020 to 2024
● You can either create an API to fetch this data or just put this data in a file in your frontend
codebase.
Description:
Based on this data, create a table (call it “main table”) with the following columns:
1. Year
2. Number of total jobs for that year
3. Average salary in USD
Users should be able to sort the table by any column.

Task 2: Analytics
Now our users want to understand this data even further. Using the same data, create the following:
1. A line graph that shows how this number has changed from 2020 to 2024 (kaggle link above has
similar bar graph)
2. Now, when I click a row from our main table, a second table should appear that displays
aggregated job titles and the number of jobs for that year. For example, if the user clicks on
2022, all the titles from 2022 should appear in another table, along with the sum of how many
times each job appeared in 2022.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
